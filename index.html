            <p>Steps to Create a Python Package

              Working with Python packages is really simple. All you need to do is:

              Create a directory and give it your package's name.
              Put your classes in it.
              Create a __init__.py file in the directory
              That's all! In order to create a Python package, it is very easy. The __init__.py file is necessary because with this file, Python will know that this directory is a Python package directory other than an ordinary directory (or folder – whatever you want to call it). Anyway, it is in this file where we'll write some import statements to import classes from our brand new package.

              Example On How to Create a Python Package

              In this tutorial, we will create an Animals package – which simply contains two module files named Mammals and Birds, containing the Mammals and Birds classes, respectively.

              Step 1: Create the Package Directory

              So, first we create a directory named Animals.
